  Zero-configuration pre-processor for <strong>generating runtime and static TypeScript/GraphQL types</strong> based on JSON schemas.
</p>

## Features

‚úçÔ∏è **JSON Schema** for defining external interfaces (APIs, database, user input)

üåà **Generate** static and runtime TypeScript types

üòé Generated files look great thanks to **prettier**, formatted according to your project settings.

## Prerequisites

- put your JSON schemas files in the folders where you want the generated types to be placed
- use the following pattern for naming files `<typeName>.schema.json`
- add a `$comment` attribute to your schemas and define which outputs should be generated:
  ```
    "$comment": "+ts +iots +graphql"
  ```

Note: for `+iots` install [`io-ts`](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)(a TypeScript compatible runtime type system for IO decoding/encoding).
Note: `+graphql` is not supported yet.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i schema-script -g
schema-script <dir-with-schemas>
ss  <dir-with-schemas>
```

`schema-script` will go over all files matching the pattern `<typeName>.schema.json`. It will generate TypeScript files next to the schema file as following `<TypeName>.ts`.

## Examples

See [./examples](examples) for some examples of generated types.

## Get Help

Probably `schema-script` is not working as expected for all possible JSON schemas. It needs more testing and your feedback:
